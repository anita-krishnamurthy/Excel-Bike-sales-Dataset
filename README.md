# Bike Sales Data Analysis

This project utilizes a dataset of bike sales to analyze key business metrics, such as revenue and profit, by year, country, and age group. The primary tools used in this analysis are Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, which allow for easy comparison and visualization of the data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about bike sales, including the following columns:

- **Year**: The year of the sale.
- **Country**: The country where the bike was sold.
- **Age Group**: The age group of the customer (e.g., 18-30, 31-45, etc.).
- **Revenue**: The revenue generated from each sale.
- **Profit**: The profit earned from each sale.

## Analysis Overview

The goal of this analysis is to use Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to derive insights from the dataset by comparing the following:

- **Revenue and Profit by Year**: We can see how the revenue and profit have changed over time.
- **Revenue by Country**: We compare the total revenue from different countries to identify high-performing regions.
- **Revenue by Age Group**: This allows us to see which age groups contribute the most to revenue.

### Pivot Table & Pivot Chart Usage

1. **Revenue and Profit by Year**:
   - A Pivot Table is created with the **Year** as the row and both **Revenue** and **Profit** as values.
   - A Pivot Chart (e.g., a line chart or bar chart) is then used to visualize how revenue and profit have evolved over the years.

2. **Revenue by Country**:
   - A Pivot Table is set with **Country** as the row and **Revenue** as the value.
   - A Pivot Chart (such as a bar or column chart) is used to compare revenue by country and identify regional trends.

3. **Revenue by Age Group**:
   - A Pivot Table is created with **Age Group** as the row and **Revenue** as the value.
   - A Pivot Chart can be used to display the revenue distribution across different age groups, which helps in identifying target demographics.
